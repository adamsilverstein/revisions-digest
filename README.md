# Revisions Digest

**This is a work in progress.**

A WordPress plugin which generates digests of changes to content via their revisions. This allows users to keep track of changes to content which they may be interested in - for example changes to pages on a documentation website.

Digests can be consumed via:

* [x] A dashboard widget
* [ ] Email
* [ ] An RSS feed
* [ ] A REST API endpoint

The default duration for a digest is weekly. In a future version this will be configurable.

## Minimum Requirements ##

**PHP:** 7.0  
**WordPress:** 4.8
