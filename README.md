# Revisions Feed

A WordPress plugin which generates RSS feeds, REST API endpoints, and admin dashboard features to display recent changes to content via their stored revisions.

This allows users to keep track of changes to content which they may be interested in - for example changes to pages on a documentation website.

This plugin does not yet exist. I'm using GitHub to plan the features and write a good spec via GitHub issues before I begin building it.
