# Revisions Digest

A WordPress plugin which generates digests and feeds of changes to content via their stored revisions. Digests can be consumed via email, RSS feeds, REST API endpoints, and admin dashboard features.

This allows users to keep track of changes to content which they may be interested in - for example changes to pages on a documentation website.

This plugin does not yet exist. I'm using GitHub to plan the features and write a good spec via GitHub issues before I begin building it.
